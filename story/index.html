            We first met during college &ndash; Wendy’s roommates were in the same computer science program as Alex, and
            he would come over often to study and play games with them. Senior year, we shared a sociology class, one of
            the few classes we could possibly have shared together since there was so little overlap between our degrees.
            We started dating April 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2015, just before graduating and settling down on the southwest side
            of Madison.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Coincidentally, our career paths became more similar than different. After graduating, Alex entered the
            healthcare information technology industry in the Madison area. Wendy took on many roles in the local
            healthcare space before being accepted into medical school at UW. We share many joys in life including home
            projects, traveling, cooking, and most recently taking care of our sweet dog Bowie.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            In December 2019, a week before the beginning of a few months apart for Wendy’s hospital rotations in
            Marshfield, we decided to have one last Friday spicy wing night. Friday wing nights are a dear tradition of
            ours well-known to our friends. This time we decided to have some fun with it by modeling it after
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8gVMuIywe8">Hot Ones</a>, using a set of hot
            sauces Wendy got Alex for Christmas. We prepared our own sets of questions to interview each other, just
            like the show. On the last question, Wendy went first, and jokingly asked Alex when he was going to propose.
            Little did she know that Alex’s last question was THE question.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Many of you, friends and family alike, have been a huge part of what makes us the individuals we are today.
            We are so happy to share our hopes and dreams with you on our special day. We are excited for what the
            future will bring.
        </p>
